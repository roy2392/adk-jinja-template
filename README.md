A best-practices template for building sophisticated, modular, and scalable multi-agent systems using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).

This repository provides a robust foundation for developing, testing, and deploying autonomous AI agents. It emphasizes a clean architecture that separates concerns, making it easy to extend, maintain, and collaborate on complex agent-based applications.

## ✨ Features

*   **Modular Architecture**: A clean separation of concerns between core logic, tools, and agent definitions.
*   **Google ADK Focused**: Built from the ground up to leverage the power and flexibility of the Google Gemini family of models.
*   **Extensible Tooling**: Easily add new tools and capabilities for your agents to use.
*   **Configuration Driven**: Separate your agent, model, and logging configurations from the core code using YAML files for easy management.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Management**: Utilizes a Jinja-based templating approach for creating flexible and reusable prompts.
*   **Ready for Experimentation**: Comes with Jupyter notebooks for rapid prototyping, prompt tuning, and agent behavior analysis.
*   **Containerized**: Includes a `Dockerfile` for building and deploying your agents in a reproducible environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9 or higher
*   An API key for Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Vertex AI.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-ai-project.git
cd agentic-ai-project
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Google API key:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

The application will load this key using `python-dotenv`.

## Usage

To run an example agent, navigate to the `examples` directory and run one of the scripts.

```bash
python examples/your_example_script.py
```

*(Note: You will need to create an example script in the `examples` directory to demonstrate the functionality.)*
